    <td>In this lesson we set about thinking about how to use the flashing lights. After this we went over and collected our Fuze box, accessories and flashing lights, after this we plugged in our Fuze box and got to work. We did very well on this front and solved problems as we were met with them.</td>

    <td>I need to work on being more vigilant when it comes to problems with my Fuze box, more times than not it could have been a simple fix, but it took me a long time to solve. I need to think about what i'm going to do when I see a problem as quickly and as efficiently as I possibly can.</td>
