  <tr>
    <td>I learned that trying to focus on my work was much more important than anything else, when thinking about something I need to think about it logically rather than just going with what feels right. I also learned that working well with my partner meant that, meant that we got through work far quicker.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on not getting distracted by things I can control (like people talking around me). If I get distracted by these people then my standard of work will quickly deteriorate, meaning myself and my partner completes less work in the time given. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure I use the skills listed above so that my work is more complete and shows better working on my part, I will also make sure that I follow all instructions given by the teacher to avoid being left being and/or targeted for my work or lack of.</td>
