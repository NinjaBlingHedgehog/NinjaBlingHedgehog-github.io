    <td>I looked at the code and our teacher told us to change our template because otherwise our templates would all look the same so I went on a color picking website and picked a color scheme i thought looked fresh and that no one else would have thought of.

After that we looked at changing other parts of our blog for example i looked through the code and it said something about solid lines so instead of having a solid line I put `dotted line` and I went back over to my blog and refreshed my page and sure enough the line was dotted.</td>

    <td>One of the things I found difficult on the computer is that I had a few attempts at trying to get my jsbin file to work I tried for quite a long time at home and at school to get my background of my letters of the background of the line to change even when identically coping my partners work it still was not work I am guessing that I missed out a comma or something like that hopefully it will work next time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I am a very forgetful person so when my teacher will say something I will often not remember and my first question to my partner will be `what are we supposed to be doing`?

I will also sometimes stare into space for long periods of time and then snap back into reality 3 minutes later usually when we have been sent to do some work.I will then be clueless and have a mini panic attack thoughts spinning around thinking what will happen and i try not to do it anymore it only seldom happens now.</td>
