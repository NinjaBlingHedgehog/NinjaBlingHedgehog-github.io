    <td>I learned that always giving clear and understandable instructions, meant that we completed the task much more quickly and that we were more efficient when doing aforementioned task. We are very close now to getting on to using the flashing lights. A few more tasks and we will be on to them, which I definitely feel ready for!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited our learning were that we sometimes miscommunicated the instructions that we had to do. A certain time I realised we had missed out an exercise and we had to go back and do it all over again.  It is mistakes like these that I will try my hardest to avoid in the future.</td>

    <td>I will make sure me and my partner are both on track and that we weren't getting distracted by other members of the class. We also need to make sure that we are always doing the right task and that we don't miss any important information from the teacher.  </td>
