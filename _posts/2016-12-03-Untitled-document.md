    <td>We had to be careful, and make sure that all the characters were correct. If all the characters were right, it would always work, so we knew that we had done something wrong it would always be because we entered a wrong character. We stayed vigilant of this and we were fine!</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to be more accepting to other people's ideas, sometimes I wrote off others ideas as wrong straight away because I didn't agree with it. I need to be more careful when it comes to denying other people's ideas because theyâ€™re sometimes right!</td>

    <td>I will always think before saying something, checking that it is necessary to what we are learning, and that it helps other people and myself.
