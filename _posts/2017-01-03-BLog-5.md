    <td> In this lesson we started looking at space invaders our teacher played the game while fittingly interrogating us on the details of the game he would ask us questions the whatever anyone answered no-one knew.

We were told to write some code which would follow the basic similarities of space invaders.</td>

    <td>In this lesson we were told to find things that were maybe not so obvious to the general eye and to most of these questions I did not know and at home I have been trying some games which help me to see less obvious things in a large crowd

In the long term I hope this lets me answer some of these more difficult questions.</td>

    <td>In the next lesson I hope to pay greater attention to more complex question/word problems and if my classmate was talking then I should not listen to them but get on with my work

This week I felt was not very good and I hope to improve on this next week </td>
