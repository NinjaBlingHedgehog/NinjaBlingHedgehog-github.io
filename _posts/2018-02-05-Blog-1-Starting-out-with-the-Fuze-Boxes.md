    <td>I learnt that always listening to the ideas of others was more effective than just thinking about them by yourself. Immediately dismissing the ideas of others means that you will only have one brain instead of two, and more brain power is always better than less brain power.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure I am not distracted by others around me and that my work is always mine and my partner's responsibility, and no-one else's.  If I always think about other people whilst doing my work then I will not work as hard and I will not produce as good work as others.  </td>

    <td>I will make sure that I will always listen to the teacher and make sure I do not disrupt them so that I can catch all important details that are mentioned. Also so others can do the same.</td>
