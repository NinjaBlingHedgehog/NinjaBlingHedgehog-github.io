    <td>In this lesson we (Rohit, Luke and I, I changed groups to work in a three) worked through the Fuze booklet, they were further on than me and Rex were so there were lots of new things that were in the book. We aech swapped around doing the typing and the reading and all of that, so that we could work as fast as possible and so that everyone felt they were getting a fair turn.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure that I am efficient at the beginning of the lesson, and get all the things that we need to use in the lesson and collect them quickly. I also need to make sure that our group is all on the same page and that we all know what we are doing and have the same ideas in our head, so we each know what each other is thinking about doing. If that makes sense.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For next time I will make sure that I do all things listed in the above and make sure that my instructions are clear so my partners know what we are doing and none of us get confused. I also need to make sure that I am working as quickly and efficiently as I can to get my work done to the highest standards I can produce and that I do this in the shortest space of time possible, to make the most of the lesson.</td>
