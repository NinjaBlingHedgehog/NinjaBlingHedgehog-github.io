    <td>In this lesson we learned how to program our lights to flash at regular intervals, this turned out to work very well, as we had our flashing lights working inside twenty minutes, we used our knowledge and the Fuze book to help us complete the task. We were very pleased with the result.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on being distracted by other people and concentrating on mine and my partner's work, otherwise, we will never get our work done in the time frame and it will not be created to a good standard. I will make sure that this is my target for next lesson. I think this is a big problem in my learning and I am working on fixing it.</td>
