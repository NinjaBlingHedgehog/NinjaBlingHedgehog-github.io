(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned that I focus better if I have nothing in my hand and nothing to fiddle with or that i'm not looking back to see what anyone else is doing. 

It helped if i just focused on the teacher and what they were saying. I also learned that a kilobyte was one with 3 zeros a megabyte, was 1 with 6 zeros is  a gigabyte,1 with 9 zeros and a terabyte is 1 with 12 zeros. I also that it was cool that it was so simple to make your own website! Before this i thought you needed a computer degree to do it but that is not the case!</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on the fact that i am a very talkative person and that sometimes i will chat instead of doing my work. I am now trying to stop myself from talking so much. I understand that talking isn't always bad but in lessons when i am supposed to be learning and doing my work, i understand why this is unacceptable.

Quite a lot of the time one of my friends will call me over and i usually will talk to then i should say "we can chat later now I am doing my work" - something like that.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nothing enormous but i would like to listen more to teachers and i would also like to be more accepting to new methods of doing things for example in maths our teacher showed us a new method i did not think this method was any faster or more efficient than the one i already used. So i used my old method after 10 minutes i was on about question 9 i looked over to the person sitting next to me to check that i wasn't awfully behind- turned out he was on question 26 after that i used my teacher's method and it was so much quicker and simpler. That really taught me a lesson.</td>
