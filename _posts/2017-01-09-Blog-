    <td>In our latest lesson we checked our homework and our teacher paced around the room catching anyone out who had brought paper into a computing lessonâ€¦ god forbid! After that we discovered that we were going to be making a final, polished scratch game as our end of topic project our teacher provided us with the planning sheet and we got to work! </td>

    <td>In this lesson, we were tasked with creating our own game and planning what happened in it and how we won. 

When this happened i automatically thought of a idea instantly and thought i should that but after a bit of thinking i realized i should spend longer thinking about  my ideas.</td>

    <td>Next time i will make sure that if i have an idea then i will think it through thoroughly and think about, Is it realistic? Is it possible?

Next Time i will try to spend a longer amount of time reviewing my ideas because sometimes they may be incomplete and/or not possible.</td>
