    <td>This lesson we set about using the Flashing Lights for the second time, we were excited to get to grips with them more. Me and Rohit were working together in a pair this week. We tried to work quickly and efficiently and I thought we were successful in this area. The flashing lights worked well and i'm sure with a couple more weeks we could have moved on to the Robot Arms.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on being more focused on my work, sometimes, Rohit says he will be fine with the reading and coding where we should both be working as a team.  If we work as a team we will complete the tasks much more quickly and our work will be higher quality. We will also be more likely to make less mistakes.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

    <td>When me and Rohit are working together I will make sure to always support him and will always work with him to spot any potential problems. This will mean that me and Rohit will work well together and complete our work in a timely and quality way.</td>
