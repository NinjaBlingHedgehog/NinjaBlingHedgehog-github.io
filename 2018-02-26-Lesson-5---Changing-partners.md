    <td>I learned that always being vigilant and looking out for problems is always the best solution. When Aayush and I spotted a problem we always quickly resolved it. We always used our initiative and thought hard about what we were going to do before we did it. When our monitor wasn't working we made sure  to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently.</td>

    <td>I need to work on being distracted by things around me, when people talk to me I need to make sure that they don’t distract me and that I carry on doing what I was doing before. If my attention goes off my work then I will not work to the highest standard and my grades will fall.</td>
