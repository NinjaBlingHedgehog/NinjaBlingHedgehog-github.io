    <td>In today's lesson we started by looked at and fixing any bugs on our maze game. I learned by listening to what our teacher was telling us and if I did not understand anything then i would ask the person sitting next to me.

We had a look at adding a villain to our scratch maze game who would make your life horrible. By shooting things at you and/or making you lose lives.</td>

    <td>In this lesson I did not see the fact that one of my pieces of code were faulty. 
One of the parts of code instead of saying "turn direction to 90 degrees then move forward 10 steps" it said “turn direction to 900 degrees then move forward 10 steps” 

I need to be more vigilant about things like this.</td>
