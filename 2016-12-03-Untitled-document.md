    <td> We learnt how to create a maze game in Scratch, an online coding website.I had used scratch a small amount on previous occasions but was not fully informed on all the controls this lesson definitely helped me learn scratch and get fully enlightened on the topic. 

We were first assigned to create some simple code which let our scratch move. We then duplicated this to let our scratch move in multiple directions.</td>

    <td>I need to sometimes be more logical with my thinking, when i just completed my scratch homework i was having some trouble. My maze was outside the map and you could not see the end of the maze. I asked my dad for some help and we could not work anything out so my dad left the room and just after I found the shrink key!</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by listening more in class and not chatting to my friends. In the case of scratch I will be more vigilant when i see more keys which will help me further down the line e.g a duplicate/enlarge /shrink keys because there is no point not using keys that are there to make my life easier, what is the point of having something if i'm not going to use it!</td>
